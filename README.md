Program Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability README
In this README, I will answer some questions related to maintaining, reading, and adapting programs, as well as how computer science impacts companies like Grazioso Salvare.

Maintaining, Reading, and Adapting Programs
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it is important to follow some best practices such as:

Writing clear and concise code with proper formatting and documentation.
Following a consistent coding style and using meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
Using modular design and breaking down large tasks into smaller functions or modules.
Using version control systems to track changes and collaborate with others.
Testing code thoroughly to ensure correctness and reliability.
Working on the CRUD Python module in Project One and connecting it to the dashboard widgets in Project Two allowed us to develop a program that was maintainable, readable, and adaptable. The advantages of this approach included:

Separation of concerns: The database access code was separated from the dashboard code, making it easier to maintain and update each part of the program separately.
Reusability: The CRUD module could be reused in other projects, saving time and effort.
Flexibility: The module could be adapted to work with different databases or data structures without changing the dashboard code.
In the future, we could use the CRUD Python module to develop other programs that require database access, such as web applications or data analysis tools.

Approaching Problems as a Computer Scientist
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems in a structured and logical manner. My approach to the Grazioso Salvare project involved the following steps:

Understanding the requirements: I first analyzed the requirements and constraints of the project to determine what was needed.
Designing the solution: I then created a plan to meet the requirements, including designing the database schema and dashboard layout.
Implementing the solution: I wrote code to implement the design and tested it for correctness and efficiency.
Documenting the solution: I documented the code and database schema to make it easier to maintain and update in the future.
Compared to other courses, this project required a more comprehensive understanding of how databases and dashboards work together to solve real-world problems. In the future, I would use similar techniques and strategies to create databases to meet other client requests, including understanding the client's needs and designing a solution that meets those needs efficiently and effectively.

Impact of Computer Science on Companies
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design and develop new technologies, research and explore new areas of computing, and work on solutions to complex problems. The work done on the Grazioso Salvare project would help the company do their work better by:

Improving efficiency: By automating data entry and retrieval tasks, the database and dashboard would save time and effort, allowing employees to focus on more important tasks.
Improving decision-making: By providing easy access to data, the dashboard would enable employees to make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information.
Improving scalability: The database and dashboard could be scaled up or down as needed to handle increasing or decreasing amounts of data.
Overall, computer science has a significant impact on companies like Grazioso Salvare, and the work done on this project demonstrates how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and improve efficiency and effectiveness.[GraziosoREADME.docx](https://github.com/tybomb21/CS-340/files/11305371/GraziosoREADME.docx)
